# Bank project with C  
The presented project is a simple banking application designed to manage the financial transactions of clients within a bank. 
The application supports two types of users: administrators and clients.

The administrator has the ability to add new clients, create bank accounts for these clients,
manage existing users, perform operations such as depositing and withdrawing money, and view the complete transaction history of the bank.

Clients can log in to their accounts, perform deposit and withdrawal operations, check their balance, view their transaction history, and update their personal information.

The program uses data structures such as linked lists to store client and account information, as well as defined structures to represent transactions and dates.

The application offers a menu-based user interface where users can select the operations they want to perform. Authentication is managed through a unique identifier for each user.

The code is written in the C language and structured around functions that implement various features of the application. It provides simple error and success handling for the operations performed
